Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. It was developed as part of a course I took in college, where I learned how to apply ML algorithms to real-world healthcare datasets.

Overview
The goal is to build a model that can identify whether a person is likely to have kidney disease based on clinical input data. The project includes steps like data cleaning, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Files
kindney_disease_prediction_using_ML.ipynb: Main notebook with all the steps from loading the data to training and evaluating multiple models.

kidney_disease_testing.ipynb: Used to test predictions on new or sample data.

Tools and Libraries
Python

pandas

scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors

Support Vector Machine

Notes
The dataset had missing values, so I applied basic preprocessing techniques to handle them. After training the models, I compared their performance using accuracy and classification reports.

About
This is a learning project built to strengthen my understanding of ML concepts. Itâ€™s a simple but practical example of how machine learning can assist in healthcare diagnosis.
